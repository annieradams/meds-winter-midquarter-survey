2/5/2025 10:52:02,Yes,Yes,2,2,2,1,"I think I'm learning a lot of different models and functions related to machine learning, but I wish we spent more time understanding /how/ these models work. I feel like the conceptual side is relatively light compared to the applied side. This feels in direct opposition to our stats course last quarter, where the emphasis was very clearly on making sure the students understood why we were making the choices we had. Understanding the concepts feels crucial for my learning. It's the concepts that I need a professor to explain; the function I can parse via the documentation or in section with Annie. ",Yes,2,1,3,"I think Sam is a wonderful lecturer and I'm learning a lot of cool new things about ggplot and data visualization in general. One thing that's really been bothering me about this class, however, has to do with the tokens aspect of the specs grading. Having a limited, valuable resource related to class causes me more anxiety than I would like it too. I recall Ruth saying last quarter that the point of specs and resubmission is to encourage iterative revision. For me--the tokens have the opposite effect. I feel significant pressure to pass on the first submission because the scarcity of the tokens generates a lot of anxiety. I recognize this anxiety isn't particularly rational, and dropping the threshold to 2 tokens as opposed to 3 helped a lot, but I wanted to encourage the instructors to be mindful of the varying socio-economic backgrounds of the students. People who feel an intense scarcity mindset often grow up with less. I think this is something to consider in:re the accessibility of the specs grading system for people across socio-economic classes. ",Yes,2,2,"Adam is a wonderful teacher! I'm very much enjoying this class so far, and it's clear how much he cares about making sure we all understand the concepts. I wish this class was a full 4 units; I think he should be an equivalent amount of time as our other lecturers so he wouldn't have to rush/cut material. I also think the class content is crucially important for us to know. Our stats class last quarter only covered 2 statistic models, linear and logistic regression. There are so many other fundamental stats models I feel like we should be covering to be a competent data scientist, and we're covering them in this class. I don't understand why it's been de-prioritized to 2 units. ",Yes,3,2,"I think the class is incredibly useful when we are given group working time. I've found most of the workshops to be generally unhelpful and feel like a waste of valuable group working time. Scheduling is very difficult. When we are all in the same room at the same time, I would appreciate time to work as a group, rather than listening to a lecture. I recognize the various lecture content is important, but they could be condensed to an email, or a much shorter version of what they are now. ",
2/6/2025 10:15:15,Yes,Yes,2,2,3,1,"I would really like if we had more instruction during our lab. When we just work on our own in class, it can sometimes feel like a waste of time",Yes,2,3,2,"overall I really like this class. I have been struggling a lot with the homeworks, but we can resubmit so it's not a huge deal. I know this can't change this quarter, but a three hour class is way too long for me to pay attention effectively the whole time. I also am struggling a little bit with the tokens situation. I've been talking with some friends about how we feel like the token situation is making us not want to have to resubmit because we want to save all our tokens for a later ""emergency"". I think it would be nice if everyone could resubmit, always, with no penalties",Yes,2,2,"This class feels a little out of place, and we tend to run out of time every single class, but I understand it's because we only meet once a week. I would like if all the important information was put on slack instead of split up between slack and email, as I get like a hundred emails a day, and it's hard for me to see the emails in a timely manner if the email is hidden among all my others",Yes,2,2,"I understand why we're doing so much conflict resolution stuff, but honestly it feels like a little bit of a waste of time. I think that we're adults and we can handle conflict in groups well already. I would like to have more group work time in class, as I feel like I'm drowning in capstone stuff outside of it. ",

",Yes,2,3,The lab was long and confusingly written. Adam and Annie are awesome though. ,Yes,4,4,"Carmen and Sandy are awesome. I wish we had a little more direction and coworking project time, however.",
2/6/2025 17:08:55,Yes,Yes,2,2,3,1,Annie is very helpful for labs!!,Yes,2,2,2,,Yes,2,3,"For the homework, the grading was very difficult. It felt like if you didnt say a very specific thing you got the question wrong, even if you answered the question correctly.",Yes,2,3,"I  enoyed the first workshop, but the second one about conflict felt extremely repetitive from the first one and not very helpful. It feels like the class is focused on conflict resolution as opposed to our projects. It would be great if we got more coworking time with our team during class!",
2/6/2025 18:34:20,Yes,Yes,2,2,1,2,"Personally, I  haven't felt the lectures to be very engaging.",Yes,2,3,2,,Yes,2,3,Feels like this class was meant to be 4 units.,Yes,3,2,"This class is a long 3 hours. Consensus seems to be that we thought there would be more time set aside for us to actually work on our projects. Personally would appreciate a bit more guidance on how to actually start them. I am hot/cold on the usefulness of the workshops. I recognize that not everyone has the same soft skills. Probably best to include them, but some felt a bit lenghtly or like a corporate obligation.",
